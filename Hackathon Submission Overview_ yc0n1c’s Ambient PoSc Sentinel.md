## **A2A \- Agents Hackathon – Ambient PoSc Sentinel**

We’re building a real-world, ambient AI agent that continuously monitors Proof-of-Scale (PoSc) metrics from startups—such as revenue growth, user spikes, product usage, sentiment—and **automatically triggers funding events or governance alerts** when milestones are achieved.

This agent is:

* **Autonomous**: Runs continuously and passively in the background  
* **Explainable**: Uses Claude and Mistral to generate audit-traceable logic  
* **Secure**: Employs Temporal workflows and Vault Inbox approvals to manage capital disbursement  
* **Trustworthy**: Keeps humans in the loop and never acts without transparency

## **Why This Project Is a Winning Submission**

### **✅ Perfect Alignment with Hackathon Goals**

* The challenge is to build **AI agents that ingest data, interpret it, and take end-to-end action**.  
* **yc0n1c’s PoSc Watchdog** does exactly that—using real traction data from startups to autonomously make funding decisions or trigger alerts.

### **✅ Ambient by Design**

* Our agent doesn't wait for prompts—it listens to live data events and responds when appropriate.  
* It’s event-triggered, persistent, scalable, and operates in the background, exactly matching the **ambient agent model** outlined by organizers.

### **✅ Enterprise-Ready Use Case**

* Venture capital is a high-stakes, real-world domain. This isn’t a toy project—**it solves a real-world funding automation problem** with serious implications for global startups.

### **✅ Human-in-the-Loop \+ Trust Layer**

* Organizers emphasized trust and oversight in agent decisions.  
* Our Vault Inbox keeps humans involved in all funding approvals, with a full audit trail of the agent’s reasoning.

### **✅ Multi-Sponsor Integration**

We’re showcasing integration with multiple sponsors including:

* **HockeyStack** (user metrics)  
* **Mixpanel** (product analytics)  
* **Orkes** (workflow engine)  
* **Senso.ai** (summary generation)  
* **Bright Data** (social traction)  
* **Temporal** (secure orchestration)  
* **Claude / Mistral** (rationale generation)

That puts us in direct alignment with **multiple prize categories**, including:

* Best use of Senso  
* Best use of Bright Data MCP  
* Best use of workflow orchestration (Orkes)  
* Best use of Mixpanel  
* Most innovative multi-tool agent

---

## **Project Architecture Summary**

* **PoSc Connector SDK** allows startups to share data securely  
* **MCP layer** listens to:  
  * `users`, `invoices`, `feature_usage`, `sentiment`, and more  
* **Temporal** governs milestone workflows  
* **Claude / Mistral** interpret signals and write rationale  
* **Senso.ai** summarizes it all for Vault Inbox  
* **Vault Inbox** presents actions for human approval  
* **Once approved**, funds are released—fully autonomous \+ explainable

---

## **Example Use Case Triggers**

* 💵 Revenue spikes (from $18K → $27K MRR)  
* 🚀 Customer surge (250 new signups, 70% activation)  
* 🧠 Sentiment signals (800+ mentions, 87% positive)  
* 🧱 Product release impact (feature usage ↑ 3.5x)  
* 🧭 Operational excellence (deadlines met 90%+ of time)

Each event flows ambiently into our system. No prompt needed. No inbox zero mentality. **Just a smart, ever-present investor watching the signals and acting accordingly.**

---

## **Team Objectives**

* **MVP Ready by 2 PM**: data integration \+ one trigger working end-to-end  
* **3-Minute Demo Polished by 4 PM**: one live event → agent action → human approval  
* **All sponsor usage is clearly highlighted in slides \+ verbal walkthrough**  
* **Explainable. Enterprise-grade. Ambient. Multi-tool. Real.**

To realize **Ambient PoSc Sentinel**—a real-time, ambient AI agent that autonomously monitors PoSc signals from startups and triggers funding actions—we need a secure, event-driven infrastructure that connects directly to startup data environments (SQL/MongoDB/etc.), continuously listens for qualifying metrics, and interacts with human stakeholders through a trust-based loop.

Here’s a comprehensive blueprint that includes **connectivity architecture**, a **data table schema**, **security layers**, and **sponsor integration opportunities**.

---

## **How Startups Connect Their PoSc Data to yc0n1c**

### **1\. Secure PoSc Data Gateway (yc0n1c Connector Client)**

Create a lightweight **yc0n1c Connector SDK** or **secure webhook system** that startups can install or configure. This client does the following:

* Authenticates with yc0n1c using **JWT \+ API keys**  
* Sends **event-based updates** via webhooks (for SQL triggers or cron jobs)  
* Alternatively, streams updates into yc0n1c via **change data capture** (CDC) on MongoDB or SQL (Postgres, MySQL)  
* Encrypted with TLS/SSL and backed by **Temporal workflows** to ensure retries, observability, and traceability

### **2\. Data Access Modes**

| Method | Use Case | Technology |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Webhook API** | Lightweight event triggers | REST \+ Temporal |
| **SDK Integration (Node/Python)** | Rich data sharing, schema mapping | yc0n1c Connector SDK |
| **CDC Event Streaming** | Realtime syncing from MongoDB/SQL | Debezium, Kafka, Orkes |
| **Batch CSV Upload Portal** | Manual fallback option | Admin UI |

---

## **Exhaustive List of Tables \+ PoSc Signals to Monitor**

Here’s a comprehensive schema yc0n1c could monitor:

### **User Growth Metrics**

| Table Name | Key Fields | Trigger Events |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `users` | user\_id, signup\_date, plan, country | \+100 net users, churn \<5% last 30 days |
| `user_activity_logs` | user\_id, timestamp, action\_type | Daily active users \> milestone threshold |
| `subscriptions` | user\_id, status, plan\_type, renew\_date | Upgrade surge, \<3% cancellation rate |

### **Revenue Metrics**

| Table Name | Key Fields | Trigger Events |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `invoices` | invoice\_id, amount, paid\_at | Monthly revenue \> $X, %MoM growth \> 20% |
| `transactions` | user\_id, type, amount, source | Net revenue spike, enterprise contract win |
| `revenue_snapshots` | month, total\_revenue, gross\_margin | ARR milestone hit |

### **Product Usage**

| Table Name | Key Fields | Trigger Events |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `feature_usage` | user\_id, feature\_name, usage\_count | High retention on key feature |
| `session_logs` | session\_id, duration, active\_modules | Avg. session time \> X mins |
| `workflow_stats` | workflow\_id, success\_rate, retries | Success rate \> 95% across workflows |

### **Customer Feedback / Sentiment**

| Table Name | Key Fields | Trigger Events |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `feedback_scores` | user\_id, score (1–10), comment | \>8 avg NPS for 30 days |
| `support_tickets` | ticket\_id, resolution\_time, satisfaction | CSAT \> 90%, ticket volume down 20% |
| `social_mentions` | source, sentiment\_score, volume | Public sentiment \> 0.7 over 14 days |

---

## **Safety & Trust Considerations**

* **End-to-End Encryption** (TLS for in-transit, AES-256 for storage)  
* **Human-in-the-loop Workflow**  
  * All disbursements require approval in the **yc0n1c Vault Inbox**  
  * Explainable rationale generated by Claude/Mistral using audit trail  
* **Event Traceability** via **Temporal**: retry logic, rejection logs, origin source attached  
* **Field-Level Permissions**: only PoSc-related fields required—no PII necessary  
* **Webhook Rate Limits \+ Throttling** to prevent abuse

## **Specific Use Case Examples**

### **Use Case Flow: Monitors Sales – Revenue Milestone Trigger**

**Goal:** Detect a sustained increase in sales volume and unlock growth funding.

**Flow:**

1. `Stripe Data`   
   1. `Growth rate over previous week`  
2. `Triggers`  
   1. `Funding`  
3. Funding   
4. Startup connects SQL-based `sales` and `transactions` tables to yc0n1c.  
5. Revenue grows from $18K → $27K MRR over 45 days, verified via MongoDB records.  
6. Temporal logs this as a “Revenue Growth PoSc Event.”  
7. Claude summarizes: *“SaaS startup exceeded 30% MoM growth for 2nd consecutive cycle.”*  
8. Senso.ai generates a recommendation: *“Release $15K for outbound sales expansion.”*  
9. Agent posts action to Vault Inbox: *“Approve fast-track sales capital unlock?”*

- *Sponsors*  
  - *Hockey Stack*

    *HockeyStack integrates into the yc0n1c Sales Monitoring Use Case by providing detailed behavioral analytics—revealing which campaigns, channels, or product features contributed most to the revenue growth. This context helps Claude and Senso.ai generate a more accurate, explainable funding rationale by linking the Stripe revenue spike to specific user actions and conversion journeys across the funnel.*
